# Coco the Dialogue System

Coco was created in 2018 as an example application for demonstrating the ability of a spoken dialogue system to learn new grammar rules used for speech recognition. Coco understands the input speech using the Sphinx4 automatic speech recognition system and talks using the MaryTTS speech synthesizer.

The systemâ€™s original purpose is to serve as a personal shopping assistant available in an online fashion store.

The dialogue system is named after Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel, nicknamed Coco. Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel, born in 1883, was one of the most influential French fashion designers and founder of the world-famous haute couture brand Chanel.
